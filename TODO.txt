- remove crt_type field from creatures
- think about copying inventory and mods: shoudn't it be realized in CreatureModificator, or ItemContainer? Reason: duplicated code in gateways
- think about factory metods of prototypable objects: what about bool prototype?
- resolve problem with violating law of demeter in Item and Creatures: mods() and inventory()
- think about creature modificators connected strict to creature object, a native modificators. For now, feature disabled in creature gateway
- ItemContainer::byOwner move away SQL query
- Player: move away SQL queries to gateway
- Location, CreatureModificators gateway
- CreatureContainer: think if it is still needed
